  Installation goes in two steps :

I )  PREPARING meschach 1.2
--------------------------- 

- If meschach 1.2 is already installed,   you only need to replace : 

    'LIBS'  => ['-Lmeschach-1.2 -lmes','-lm'],

in Makefile.PL by 

    'LIBS'  => ['-Lwhere_meschach_is -lmes','-lm'],

and copy "meschach.a" to "libmes.a" in the directory "where_meschach_is". 


- Otherwise,   you must cd to the Meschach/meschach-1.2 directory, and 
install meschach-1.2, with the commands : 

1)
        sh configure
        make basic
        make clean


If all went ok, you may test your installation (optionnal) :

        make torture 

   
If something went wrong, the best is to see in meschach-1.2/READMEfor
more detailed information about installaton. 

Once the file meschach.a is made,  copy it to  libmes.a,  so that it
can be linked with by using -lmes (*). 

2)      cp meschach.a libmes.a 


II)  PREPARING Meschach 
-----------------------

1)
         perl Makefile.PL
         make                 
        
        
       for some timestamp reason, you must (*)

2)
         cd meschach-1.2
         ranlib libmes.a
         cd ..

       before being able to run 

3)
         make test

     which should say "ok" 28 times, and never "NOT ok".

     The functionalities are described in Meschach.pod

4) 
         make install

     Will allow you to use Meschach (see Meschach documentation).


NOTES :
-------


(*) There should be a more elegant way of preparing meschach-1.2. The
procedure should be simplified in the future. (It's time I mastered
MakeMaker a little better).
